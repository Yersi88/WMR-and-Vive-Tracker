# WMR-and-Vive-Tracker
Tutorial on how to use Vive Tracker for head tracking of WMR headset within SteamVR

What you'll need: 
1. WMR Headset (eg. Reverb G2) 
2. Vive tracker (2.0 Recomended, 3.0 manifested increased drift in my testing) 
3. OVR Input Emulator with patched .DLL (Optional) 
4. Long 5m long USB cable. (Optional) 
5. 3D Printed mount for Vive Tracker. 

1. Mount your Vive tracker to the Headset, I recommend mounting the Tracker on the front of the headset with Charging port facing upwards.
